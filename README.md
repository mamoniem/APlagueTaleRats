The repository for the tutorial about how to make rats similar to the upcoming [A Plague Tale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bevqtZ0bXt0 "A Plague Tale: Innocence - Gameplay Overview Trailer | PS4"). The tutorial is covering several topics which including:

- Quick rigging and animating for VFX.
- Use Unreal's Vertex animation script, tools, shader nodes and pipeline.
- Getting familiar with Niagara system.
- Creating Mesh particles using Niagara
- Creating and extending Niagara Behaviors with new custom Modules/Scripts
- Creating and exposing Niagara variables to the gameplay
- Putting all togther into playable thing!

# Tutorial: #
There are two version of the tutorial, pick the one fits you the most, or even get the best with both of them!

# Todo list: #
Those are extension goals, things that I'll be working on every time I get free moment, not neccessarly to be explained in videos, but they are more to show more unreal tricks, and to expand that system to the infinity and beyond!!

- <del>Shine the rats eyes at night with emission color.</del>
- Base the rats movement on the player movement direction.
- Make sample with some random in-place movement behavior.
- Make sample that is based on the light torches mechanic (run when player only have light).
- GPU simulated sample with higher rats count! let's target 100k!
- GPU based collision detection for walls.
- Different formations for the groups to avoid having them always in squares or rectangles.
- Add different sound variations.
